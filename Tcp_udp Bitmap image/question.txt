In today LAB assignment, You all have to write a Client and Server program to send a BITMAP image file from client to server in a binary encoded form. It means you have to transform the Image into binary bit-stream and send it through Client socket. At the Server side same bit stream you have to store into a file with same file extension (Bitmap).  After completing the program in TCP/UDP, you have to analyse the performance in terms of Latency between the binary encoded text file and bitmap image file.
